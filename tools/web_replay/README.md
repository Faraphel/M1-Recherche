# Web-Replay

Allow you to replay the `web-mission` tasks that a user did while taking a survey.

# Installation

The installation is the same as the Survey-Engine. Refer to their installation step instead.

# Run

You must open a shell in the root directory (the `Survey-Engine` directory).
You can run the tool simply by using the command `python3 ./tools/web_replay/main.py`.

You will need to select a replay file `.rsl` and the mission you want to replay.

# Warning

The replay is in early development. Some features are missing and the replay is not very precise.
For now, key inputs don't seem to work correctly, so they are written on the bottom right instead.
Mouse movement are not perfect and mouse click don't seem to be recognised either.
